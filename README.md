**(a) Key Features of NumPy**

1 Fast Numerical Computation : NumPy is written in C and optimized for speed, making mathematical operations significantly faster than Python lists.

2 Multidimensional Arrays : It provides the ndarray object that supports 1D, 2D, and higher-dimensional arrays.

3 Vectorized Operations : Operations are applied on the whole array without loops — cleaner and faster.

4 Memory Efficient : NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type, reducing memory usage.

5 Large Collection of Mathematical Functions : Includes linear algebra, statistics, trigonometry, reshaping, sorting, and more.

6 Supports Broadcasting : Enables operations between arrays of different shapes.

**Differences Between NumPy Arrays and Python Lists**

| Feature          | NumPy Array                       | Python List                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Speed**        | Much faster (C optimized)         | Slower                          |
| **Data Type**    | Homogeneous (one type)            | Heterogeneous (mixed types)     |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower                             | Higher                          |
| **Operations**   | Element-wise directly             | Need loops for element-wise     |
| **Dimensions**   | Supports multi-dimensional        | Mostly 1D (nested lists for 2D) |
| **Functions**    | Large scientific function library | Limited built-in operations     |
